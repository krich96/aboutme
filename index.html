      <img id="betty" src="img/Betty-White.jpg" alt="Betty White">
      <p>The series revolves around four older single women (three widows and one divorcee) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McLanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcee Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).  They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store.  In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down [6][7].</p>
